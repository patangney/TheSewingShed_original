				<p>Our sewing retreats are inspirational – ‘The religion of Sewing’</p><br>
				<p>The Sewing Shed has been hosting retreats since 2008. We have been to various places around Ireland but also have travelled to France and Germany. </p>
				<p>Our retreats are special in so many ways, we pick relaxing locations where we can unwind and not worry about the everyday mundane chores in life. Each location is picked to suit our needs, with plenty of room to sew, create and make. All our requirements are met with good food, great company and plenty of laughs along the way. </p>
				<p>On each retreat we have offered an exclusive project to work on, or people have just brought their own things to work to make most of the time. </p>
				<p>Our last little getaway was Glengarrif, we had 30 quilters and two teachers. Some stitched around the others, stitched and relaxed. We achieved so much while we were there. We stayed at the Glengarriff Park Hotel. The food was wonderful, the staff looked after us and the accommodation was superb, and you cant beat a hotel bed after a good days sewing. </p>
				<p>If you would like to join us on our next Sewing Shed Retreat then sign up for the newsletter on the home page and you’ll be notified of the details, but if you are really intrigued, we are planning March 2018 and will be heading for the Ring Of Kerry . </p>
