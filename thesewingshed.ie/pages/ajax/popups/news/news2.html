              <p> There is so much going on at The Sewing shed that sometimes we have trouble keeping up with ourselves. 
                Situated on the Dingle peninsula we are very central to every corner of Co Kerry, however that doesn’t stop people from travelling from all over Ireland and also different countries to visit us.</p>
              <p>One-day classes, workshops and 10 week classes are available all year round and just recently we have introduced themed weekends. Summer classes are popular for visitors to the area, and everyone gets involved with our amazing Christmas classes and workshops. Our bright and spacious classroom provides the perfect environment for learning and we really do welcome everyone and anyone. </p>
              <p>Then we have the shop, packed full of everything you need for quilting and more. Our wide variety of Irish themed kits and patterns are an added bonus when visitors arrive from different countries to our little shop and all designed on site by Nikki.  Our fabric fairies are trained to a very high standard in customer service and colour matching, so there will always be someone on hand to look after you. </p>
              <p>The Sewing Shed also travels, we can bring our shop to any location and also all of our classes are available as workshops for groups. <br>
                We also offer custom classes to Tour groups and can provide kits for convenience.</p>
              <p>Kits for schools are also available, with many pre- cut kits and projects, ready to go for all levels in the education system. Also we often work with school teachers to customise kits for the students needs. </p>
              <p>Also we have a longarm quilting service, this is available all year round and we take quilts from all over Ireland and Europe. We can deliver your quilt back to you for a very reasonable price if you are not local. </p>
              <p>Fun is always on the agenda, with retreats, Christmas party, exhibitions and open days, in fact we always coming up for new ideas to keep it interesting.</p>
              <p>So if your passing by call in for a cuppa, and say hello, take a class or just browse in the shop. We are fortunate to be situated above a grocery store and little café which is very handy for leaving partners in while you visit.<br>
                The first week in June is National quilting week, and we look forward to it every year. Different exhibitions take place around the country and you never know what could take place.</p>
              <p>I hope this has given you an overview of what we do, and we also have new things happening all the time so sign up to the newsletter if you don’t what to miss out and catch up on the news. </p>
